# Flags of the world
Visualizing the peculiarities of flags for each country in the world.

## 🧐 About<a name="about"/>
As part of EPFL SHS course in graphic design we build a scraper pipeline to download all flags with corresponding information such as population, continent, and country name from wikipedia.
We develop algorithms to compute the complexity of a country's flag, extract their colors, and visualize many aspects of the flags.
